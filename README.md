# Hey, ItzKarizma here!
I'm just a CS student diving headfirst into the AI abyss, tryna make machines smarter than my ex’s decisions. I use Linux (Arch, fight me) and mess with code like it’s my side hustle. Used to rock Windows back in the day, but now it’s all bash and vibes. My GitHub’s a playground for wild ideas and noice algorithms, but mostly *private*, I'm shy... that's why you can't see most of them!  

## My Arsenal (no Gunners, just code)
- **OS**: Arch Linux + Hyprland is what life's about, Windows is... nostalgia
- **Basic Tools**: Git (obviously), Zed IDE, Zsh, and Kitty, a terminal that’s seen some *wild* commands ngl
- **AI/ML**: Just getting started, but I’m already overfitting to the grind :P
- **Languages**: C/C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and more

## My Projects
- **[fundamental-ml-algorithms-in-c](https://github.com/ItzKarizma/fundamental-ml-algorithms-in-c)**: My baby-implementing ML algorithms in C, because Python's for softies. We’re talking k-means, perceptron, and more, all written in C without any ML libraries. Star it or I'll `chown` your heart.
- **[BattleSheep](https://github.com/ItzKarizma/BattleSheep)**: A 1st year uni project where sheep get savage, beeeh... *ahem* written fully in Python. It was my first time using Python and working in a team too. Props to the crew who **grinded** instead of getting carried and using excuses to avoid doing anything. I troll for fun, but when it matters, I change gears real quick.
- The rest is private stuff I'm working on.

PS: My code’s messier than a late-night Discord raid but it does the job. *wink wink*
