# Hey, ItzKarizma here!
I'm just a CS student diving headfirst into the AI abyss, tryna make machines smarter than my ex’s decisions. I use Linux (Arch btw) and mess with code like it’s my side hustle. Used to rock Windows back in the day, but now it’s all bash and vibes. My GitHub’s a playground for wild ideas and noice algorithms, but mostly *private*, I'm shy... that's why you can't see most of them!  

## My Arsenal
- **OS**: Arch Linux + Hyprland is what life's about, Windows is... nostalgia
- **Basic Tools**: Git (obviously), VS Code, Zsh, and Kitty, a terminal that’s seen some *wild* commands ngl
- **AI/ML**: Just getting started, but I’m already overfitting to the grind :P
- **Languages**: C/C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and more

## My Projects
- **[fundamental-ml-algorithms-in-c](https://github.com/ItzKarizma/fundamental-ml-algorithms-in-c)**: My baby-implementing ML algorithms in C, because Python's for softies. We’re talking k-means, perceptron, and more, all written in C without any ML libraries. Star it or I'll `chown` your heart.
- **[BattleSheep](https://github.com/ItzKarizma/BattleSheep)**: A 1st year uni project where sheep get savage, beeeh... *ahem* written fully in Python. It was my first time using Python and working in a team too. Props to the crew who **grinded** instead of getting carried and using excuses to avoid doing anything (at least give me a shoulder massage).
- **[Shirayume.exe](https://github.com/ItzKarizma/Shirayume.exe)**: A custom discord bot with many features like moderation, economy, utils, and even a game-like progress (levels, ranks, leaderboards, etc.). It's written entirely in Python, because Python > JavaScript.
- The rest is private stuff I'm working on.
